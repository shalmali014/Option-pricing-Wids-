# Option-pricing 
This repository showcases a range of Python programming, data analysis, and introductory machine learning concepts through hands-on Jupyter notebooks. It is structured to move from core fundamentals to applied financial and analytical projects.

Contents include:

Python fundamentals: Practice notebooks covering functions, variables, loops, conditional statements, and user input to build a strong programming foundation.

Assessment and game challenge: Problem-solving exercises and a simple console-based game demonstrating logic building, control flow, and functional code structure.

Data analysis and visualization: Option pricing notebooks using NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for visualization, including line plots, scatter plots, and comparative graphs.

Machine learning applications: Linear and logistic regression models applied to option pricing using Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for result visualization.
